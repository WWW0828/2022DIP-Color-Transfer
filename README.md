## Introduction
This is the final project of CS452000 Introduction to Image Processing at National Tsing Hua University. In this project, we are going to implement previous work, ***Color Transfer between Images*** done by Erik Reinhard, Michael Ashikhmin, Bruce Gooch,and Peter Shirley.
### Quick Demos
![demo1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad0a2422-4564-44cd-9bd5-bfbba4b47d88)

## Run the program
1. clone this repository: 
    - `git clone https://github.com/WWW0828/2022DIP-Color-Transfer.git`
    - You will see 3 folders (`source/`, `target/`, and `result/`) and some MatLab codes
    - This program will apply color characteristics of target images to source images, and save the results.
2. open folder in Matalb
    - install these packages: `Fixed-Point Designer`
3. run `main.m` and you will get the result images in `result/`
